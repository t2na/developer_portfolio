            Welcome to my portfolio page! My name is Zach Antunes and I am currently enrolled in UC Berkeley's full-stack coding bootcamp. After graduating from UC San Diego with a bachelor's degree in communication, I spent the next 8 years in sales - first, as a loan originator in San Diego, and then as an account executive in the Bay Area for various technology companies like F5, VMware, and Microsoft. Once I was affected by the tech layoffs in early 2023, I decided that I needed to elevate my core technical abilities. I'm looking forward to learning more about coding, so that I can advance my career in technology. Below are some of my accomplishments from class thus far!

                This was our first project in the course, where we had to take a real, existing HTML website and clean up its code. Some of the tasks we were given were to make the website more accessible, make the CSS file flow more logically with the HTML file, and fix broken links. Click the image to see for yourself!

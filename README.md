Description

The attached project file(s) are for our second challenge as part of the UC Berkeley full stack coding bootcamp. The goal of the challenge was to create our own developer portfolio website, which could act as a living document to showcase our developer skills and projects to employers looking to fill part-time or full-time positions. Some of the parameters we were we were instructed to abide by were to include a profile picture of ourselves, links within the page that would point to other parts of the page, such as our "about me" or "projects" section, and making sure to make our page responsive to a resized viewport, such that someone using either a mobile or desktop screen could access our page without issue.

I used this project to test my ability to create HTML and CSS files from scratch, create a proper front-end design, as well as one that is adaptive to different viewports. By creating a webpage from scratch, I was better able to understand the intricacies of designing a front-end web page, such as the different elements that go into making a visually appealing and responsive html and CSS file.

Installation

No installation is required to enjoy the fruits of the project, simply visit the github pages URL.

Usage

In order to "use" the website, simply visit the URL and leverage Chrome's dev tools in order to take a look at the code that I created.

Credits

This project was created with helpful collaboration from bootcamp group 3, as well as my instructors and TAs.
